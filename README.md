For this homework I did the following:

   1. Attempted to identify the structure of the page:
      - Nav
      - Section
         - Articles
         - Aside
      - Footer

   2. Add "alt" text descriptions to each img.

   3. Added a title I thought succintly described what Horiseon (I keep reading it as HORSEON... horse on?) did.
